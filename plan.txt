Build a database

database means, a web app that allows us to store and retrieve files, images


1. when entered to site, asks user to signin/signup
2. when logged in, user can see folders and files they store
3. top nav will have
    go back to parent folder
    create a new folder
    create a new file
    upload a file
    search for files/folders
    sort files/folders
    a dynamic path to current folder
4. user can also view a file in browser

5. in personal app
    user authentication


6. nav
    if not logged in
        login, signup
    else
        logout
        new file, upload
        new folder


7. in place of folder id in url, use some large string to make it more secure

8. for each user, we create a root folder when they register

9. when user creates a new folder, he jst provides folder name
    we need to get user, parent folder and path for it
    request.user gives user
    path is just parent.path + folder name

    so we need to get the parent somehow

    <!-- we can use a session variable to store the name of the current folder that  -->
    we can use the folder_id that we pass to renderFolderView method
        we pass the same id to renderCreateFolderView method
        but problem is when creating a new folder in root folder (where the page is just home page) we don't have any folder_id
            here we can use session var
            if home page is loaded and user is logged in, we create a session variable

            or

            when a user is logged in and accesses the home page we jst redirect them to root folder page
                after login redirect user to redirect('folder', folder_id=user.root.id)
                for this add a field in User model for root folder
